    article: ' Welcome into HTML introduction <br> In the beginning HTML is a markup language used to build the structure of  websites pages and this language is the farst and main step in your  programming learning trip . <br>  HTML founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and this language has passed in several stages the first of them is HTML 1.0 then HTML 2.0 , HTML 3.0 , HTML 4.0 and last version is HTML 5.0 . <br> This language is very easy and you can use it with more languages as : CSS , JS , Python , PHP ... etc .

    article: 'In the previous lesson we learned the basics of HTML , but now we will be up to a higher degree because we will learn how to think of creating sites before we begin with actual programming . <br> And this point is very important because the most of beginners in this field face difficulties in this idea because they are not ability to imagine the final form of the project . So , we will learn how to think... , but this skill develops over time and increased experience . <br> <br> First when you wont to build a website you should to think about the benefits of this poject , then you can start thinking about the form and design of this site . And I advise you to inspire of some similar sites that has the same content you would to make about . <br> As example when you wont to build a personal website to apply on a job , here you see the closest appropriate examples for your choice and collect ideas and designs you like , but you should not try the same design you liked accurately ; because you can add your own thouches maked the traditional design vibrant and custom for you and you will feel frustrated because you were not creative if you try the same design . But that is not false to try the same design to increase your experience that is true but when you take the same design totally you will not take any benefit from this , so you have to think allot about the project before start coding . At last , I wont to tell you that main road to increase your knowledge that you do not be satisfied with learning from one source or one tutorial , but you must learn from several sources and learn from research. <br> <br> This lesson has finished.

    article: 'Welcome to our final lesson in the HTML tutorial. In this lesson, we will delve into the world of basic HTML tags. <br> In this concluding lesson, we are going to create a small application to review fundamental HTML tags and comprehend how to utilize them in real-world projects. <br> Now, what is the idea behind the application? We will be building a TODO APP. This project type aids in organizing and planning tasks you intend to undertake. <br> Before we commence, I would like to share some insights about the project. In this venture, we will need to incorporate JavaScript and CSS. However, for this lesson, we will focus solely on establishing the HTML structure of the project. <br> The remaining CSS and JavaScript codes can be found in the final lesson of the JavaScript tutorial, where you can download the entire project and modify it to enhance the design. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to me via email. <br> Now, let us dive into explaining the code. <iframe src="../../proj.html" style="width:100%;height:500px;border-radius: 15px;border:1px solid gray" frameborder="0"></iframe><br><br> When crafting your own websites, it is advisable to leverage semantic HTML to sidestep potential issues and make the development process smoother in the long run. When collaborating with a team on any project, precision in code writing is crucial to ensure it is understandable to team members throughout the development process. <br> As you write code, you should be cognizant of the programming logic you aim to traverse during site development and have a plan for what you want to achieve over time in developing this site, regardless of its scale. <br> Now, I will elucidate why I utilized certain tags in the above code. For instance, by using the "input" tag, I employed it to gather user input. <br> I created a button to submit the data entered in the input, saving it for later review in the todo list. I prefer organizing the code by encapsulating each part within a div item to facilitate the development experience for myself. Lastly, let us delve into HTML attributes. <br> Attributes in HTML are among the most pivotal elements for executing actions on your site, such as creating links to navigate to other pages or sites, among various actions that elevate your siteâ€˜s sophistication. Here are some examples of HTML attributes: To style any HTML element on your page, you can easily employ the<code> style="" </code>attribute and directly write CSS code within it. Another example, if you wish to create a link for navigation between site pages, you can use the <a> tag, include the <code>href="" </code>attribute, and specify the page target in double quotes, and weâ€™re done. I hope you derive benefit from this lesson, and remember, when you feel a lack of motivation, never give up. <br> <br> This tutorial has concluded.
